            <h2>About the Role</h2>
            <p>We're looking for a Rust Content Engineer / Technical Writer to help us turn complex Rust topics into clear, bingeable content for experienced developers.</p>
            <p>You'll sit at the intersection of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Rust engineering</li>
                <li>Teaching/communication</li>
                <li>Content creation (YouTube)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Your work will directly drive:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Audience growth and trust with mid/senior engineers</li>
                <li>Demand for our Rust Live Accelerator program</li>
                <li>Better student outcomes (clearer mental models, fewer "stuck" points)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This is <strong>not</strong> a generic "write some docs" job. This is a key role in building our long-term Rust content engine.</p>
            
            <h2>About Let's Get Rusty</h2>
            <p>Let's Get Rusty helps experienced software engineers <strong>master Rust</strong> and <strong>land serious Rust roles</strong>.</p>
            <p>Our flagship program, <strong>Rust Live Accelerator</strong>, is a cohort-based mentorship experience for mid/senior devs who are done with toy tutorials and want real projects, real feedback, and real interviews in domains like backend, infra, embedded, Web3, etc.</p>
            <p>We're profitable, growing, and doubling down on content. Now we want someone who can own the <em>teaching layer</em> of that content with us.</p>
            
            <h2>Responsibilities</h2>
            <p>You will:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Turn rough outlines or Loom recordings into <strong>spoken-word scripts</strong> for weekly Rust + career YouTube videos</li>
                <li>Propose topics based on:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Student questions</li>
                        <li>Discord conversations</li>
                        <li>Common failure patterns for mid/senior devs moving into Rust</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Decide what to explain vs what to assume for an experienced audience</li>
                <li>Ensure technical accuracy and appropriate depth (no hand-wavy Rust)</li>
                <li>Collaborate with our editor to produce <strong>2–3 Shorts per week</strong> from each long-form video</li>
                <li>Maintain a simple content tracker (topics, status, publish dates)</li>
                <li>Develop reusable patterns for intros, examples, and transitions so we move faster over time</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>What Success Looks Like in 90 Days</h2>
            <p>Outside launch weeks:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We publish <strong>1 long-form YouTube video per week</strong></li>
                <li>We publish <strong>2–3 Shorts per week</strong> pulled from that content</li>
                <li>Founders spend <strong>≤ 3–5 hours/week total</strong> on scripting and technical review</li>
                <li>Scripts read like a human teaching out loud, not like a blog post</li>
                <li>There are <strong>no "this is wrong / embarrassing" mistakes</strong> for senior Rust engineers</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If clear expectations and a scoreboard motivate you, this role will fit you.</p>
            
            <h2>Requirements</h2>
            <p><strong>Must-haves</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Strong Rust proficiency <strong>OR</strong> strong systems background with proof you can ramp quickly into Rust</li>
                <li>Portfolio that shows you can explain complex technical topics clearly (2–3 examples: blog posts, docs, talks, videos, long-form threads)
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you don't already have a portfolio, that's fine. Creating 1–3 pieces of content now that showcase your skillset also works (blog post, doc, talk outline, or short technical video). See paid test (bounty) below.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Excellent written English</li>
                <li>Ability to write in a <strong>conversational, spoken</strong> style (as if you're on camera)</li>
                <li>High ownership and comfort with feedback/iteration</li>
                <li>Ability to work remotely and reliably attend recurring calls and reviews</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Nice-to-haves</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Prior teaching or mentoring experience</li>
                <li>Experience shipping content publicly (blog, YouTube, talks, etc.)</li>
                <li>Familiarity with key Rust ecosystem topics (async, ownership/borrowing, lifetimes, performance, etc.)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>No degree requirements. Skill > pedigree.</p>
            
            <h2>Compensation & Path</h2>
            <p>We're upfront about numbers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Initial <strong>90-day contract</strong>, <strong>20–25 hours/week</strong>, at <strong>$55–65/hr</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>That's the equivalent of ~$57k–$84k/year at part-time hours</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>If we hit the 90-day scorecard together, we convert to a <strong>full-time contractor arrangement</strong>, with:
                    <ul>
                        <li>An agreed-upon hourly rate in the range <strong>equivalent to ~$95–110k/year</strong> at full-time hours</li>
                        <li>Performance-based bonuses tied to:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Videos shipped on schedule</li>
                                <li>Founder time saved</li>
                                <li>Technical quality</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>We pay for leverage and consistency, not hours for hours' sake.</p>
            <p>This role is for someone who ultimately wants to be a <strong>long‑term, full‑time</strong> contractor with us. The first 90 days are part‑time by design so we can prove it's a great mutual fit before ramping to full‑time hours.</p>
            <p>We're a small startup. There isn't much room for negotiation right now, even if we wanted to. Please make sure this compensation works for you.</p>
